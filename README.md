# PHCCS

This is a hardcore community service script made by me, Phreddrickkv2 (#1515124). It is designed to work if you are me, Phreddrickkv2 (#1515124).

If you aren't me, it may not work for you! It assumes you own a lot of things, and that you're whitelisted to `Alliance From Heck` and `Hobopolis Vacation Home`. For players not blessed with a whitelist to those clans, set the properties `phccs_mainClan` and `phccs_elfClan` to a clan that has a full VIP room, and a clan that has an available Mother Slime, respectively. You can also set `phccs_faxClan` to a clan whose fax machine you want to use. In fact, you should do that! It will probably be the same as your `mainClan`. It will also expect you to have a CCS named `twiddle`, which should consist of the single line `scrollwhendone`.

Requirements detailed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15MuMGxkg_9X-hTW6uFcu1G4dg-JmMYI3ON7i7aq1V1g/). Not guaranteed to be accurate.
