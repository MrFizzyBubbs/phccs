# PHCCS

This is a hardcore community service script made by me, Phreddrickkv2 (#1515124). It is designed to work if you are me, Phreddrickkv2 (#1515124).

If you aren't me, it may not work for you! It assumes you own a lot of things, and that you're whitelisted to `Alliance From Heck` and `Hobopolis Vacation Home`. For players not blessed with a whitelist to those clans, set the properties `phccs_mainClan` and `phccs_elfClan` to a clan that has a full VIP room, and a clan that has an available Mother Slime, respectively. You can also set `phccs_faxClan` to a clan whose fax machine you want to use. In fact, you should do that! It will probably be the same as your `mainClan`. It will also expect you to have a CCS named `twiddle`, which should consist of the single line `scrollwhendone`.

At present, PHCCS requires the following iotms/expensive old items to operate:

-   Peppermint Garden
-   Asdon Martin
-   Chateau (no monster needed, but it should be set to ceiling fan/foreign language tapes/juice bar)
-   Mumming Trunk
-   Camel
-   Stocking Mimic
-   Sweet Synthesis
-   VIP Key
-   Short Order Cook
-   Garbage Fire
-   Saber
-   Kramco
-   Scrapbook
-   Pantogram
-   LT&T (boots set to +50% myst, and +res)
-   Detective
-   Machine Elf
-   KGBriefcase
-   Pillkeeper
-   Witchess
-   Snojo
-   NEP
-   Garbage Tote
-   Emo Chip
-   LOV
-   Meteors
-   Protonpack
-   Tot
-   Docbag
-   Maps
-   Powerglove
-   Shorts
-   Lathe
-   LHM
-   Campaway
-   Cloake
-   Voter
-   Boxing Daycare
-   Bastille
-   Songboom
-   Source
-   Barrel Shrine
-   Sorcerers of the Shore Grimoire
-   Clip-Art
-   Sugar Sheets
-   Candles
-   Numberology
-   Deck
-   Ghosts
-   God Lobster
-   Fire Extinguisher
-   Daylight Shavings Helmet
-   Cursed Magnifying Glass

It also really appreciates it if you have:

-   Disembodied Hand
-   Mini-Adventurer
-   Love Songs
-   Candy Hearts
-   BRICKO
-   Candyblast
-   Love Bugs

You will need at least one of candy hearts or candyblast in order to do item synthesis.

I'm very interested in moving elements from the former list to the latter list, so if you notice something we use that you think would be easily toggled, let me know and I'll do my best to not require it. Ultimately this is still written for me, however, so I won't be cutting resources that save a lot of turns or are at all involved in routing.
